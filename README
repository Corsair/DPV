* What's With the Crappy Key Binding System?

The key bindings exist in two part of the program.  The first part is
PDFViewerConfig::KeyBindings.  The type of this member is KeyMap which
is defined to a map from QString to QString.  The key of this map is
the key binding in human-readable format (for example "Ctrl+j"), and
the value of the map is a string that correlates to a function of
PDFWindow.

The second part is PDFWindow::KeyBind.  It is a map from QKeySequence
to function pointers (FuncPt).

The user specifies key bindings in the constructor of PDFViewerConfig
in purely human-readable form.  Then in the constructor of PDFWindow,
the keys of PDFViewerConfig::KeyBindings are converted to QKeySequence
objects, and the values are converted to function pointers.  Then
these converted objects are bind in PDFWindow::KeyBind.  Note that
these functions are friends of PDFWindow in order to access the
private member PDFWindow::PDF.  As a result, functions can be called
with speed, yet it is very convenient for the user to specify key
bindings.
